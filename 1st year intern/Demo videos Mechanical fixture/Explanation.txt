Please open sound.
This probe is a  surface collision detector. 
The testing sound came from a Multimeter. 
When the probe was bent (detected an obstacle), 
the sound will disapper meaning that the switch circuit was off.
A computer will detect whether this signal is on or off 
and execute relevant commands 
(e.g. turn on the laser inside the probe 
and stop moving the probe when an collision is detected)
